# Dot Files

My configs.  This is where my dot files and other configs go.

Because of branch/tag diffuculties, I will now just clone python-mode directly to my vim/bundle folder

Also, to make django snippets and highlighting work, remember to hard-link python-mode/syntax/python.vim to ~/.vim/syntax/django.vim
